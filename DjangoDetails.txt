DJANGO FRAMEWORK

NEEDS:
 -Python Syntax
 -Functions, return, arguments/ parameters
 -modules --> group of functions, classes
 -create own modules
 -packages --> group of modules (folder) __init__.py (Script file)
 -Exceptions Handling

DJANGO (2003-2005)
-Open Source
-Macro FRAMEWORK
-Micro FRAMEWORK (Flask FRAMEWORK)
-Web FRAMEWORK
-Free

Web Application --> Design Pattern (MVC) for other frameworks
But,DJANGO doesn't followed MVC Pattern

It follows MVT pattern
  M - model 
  V - view
  T - template

Other Python frameworks like pyramid, bottle, cherrypy and tornod etc.,

Features of DJANGO:
 - Ridiculously Fast 
 - Fully Loaded
 - Reassuringly secure
 - Exceeding scalable
 - Incredibly versatile

Version Check DJANGO

    python3 -m django --version 
            (or)
    django-admin --version

VS Code Extension 
    - Platformio IDE 
    - Autocomplete Python (Tabnine AI Assistant)
    - Django for VSCode

project --> Applications + configuration files
Single Site --> Application --> books, audio, video pages

Django Project --> Many Django Applications

COMMAND LINE TOOL:

1. django-admin - Run Django project
2. django-admin startproject (foldername) - Create and Start project
3. tree -f - Checking for folder files
4. python3 manage.py runserver - server is running
5. python3 manage.py startapp applicationName - application is created


Django Folder Files:

__init__.py
    - Blank Python Script Files
    - Django will consider the particular folder as python packages

settings.py (Mostly Used)
    - Project settings, configuration files, installed applications, database configuration files, middleware configuration etc.,

urls.py (Effectively Used)
    - urls patterns will be stored
    ex: /home, /aboutus, /contactus
    - website consists web pages stored
    EXAMPLE for URL PATTERNS: http://example.com/home, http://example.com/aboutus, http://example.com/contactus 

wsgi.py (oldest file)
    -Web Server Gateway Interface
    -This file is used for production movement
    -This file is used when we deploy our application in production Server

Three Main Servers

1. DEV Environment Server - Development Environment Server
2. UAT - User Acceptance Test Environment Server (final stage of Development process)
3. Production Environment Server - Production Environment Server

asgi.py (newest file)
    -Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface
    
Synchronous - Full site is load for refresh
Asynchronous - In particular frame will be loaded
ex: Cricket Website (Scorecard only load every balls).This is called Asynchronous loading.

manage.py (most usage files)
 -server starting
 -running our server
 -running Test
 -creating migrations

 Goto Django Project folder and runserver. click the url http://127.0.0.1:8000

 Web server
    - Providing environment to run web applicaitons.
    - Servers
        - HTTPRequest --> Web Components --> HTTPResponse
 http://127.0.0.1:8000

 127.0.0.1 - IP Address - LocalHost
 8000 - Port Number

 After Run Server - db.sqlite3 file is created. sqlite3 supported in Django (Default database connection)

Web Application Creation:
    
    python3 manage.py startapp applicationName

    - application folder is created and some files are present in the folder.

Web Application folder Files

__init__.py
    - Blank Python Script Files
    - Django will consider the particular folder as python packages

admin.py
    - admin interface --> Django models 

apps.py

models.py
    - application data models

test.py
    - testing functions

views.py
    - function based views
    - class based views
    
migrations
    - db specific information stored

Step#1 : Create Web App Setting in Project setting.py file
 -Goto project folder --> settings.py --> goto "INSTALLED_APPS"
 -Add your applicationName('firstapplication')

Step#2 : User settings
 -Goto application folder --> views.py 
 -import HTTPResponse
    from django.http import HttpResponse

    add request and response messages

    def anyName(request):
        // block of Code
        return HttpResponse()
    
    ex:
    def welcome(request):
    message = '<h1>Welcome to Our First Project</h1>'
    return HttpResponse(message)

Step#3 : Browser URL Setting
 -Goto Project Folder --> urls.py file
 -import views.py file
    from firstapplication import views

 -add url path
    path('name/', views.functionName)
 ex:
 path('welcome', views.welcome)

After runserver, goto http://127.0.0.1:8080/welcome, your message was displayed.

Incase port number is changed
    python3 manage.py runserver portNumber
 ex:
 python3 manage.py runserver 8080

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
In second application was created. views.py update some issue faced

ex: from appName1 import views
    from appName2 import views

two views files are same name. it confused to urls.py file in python. so, overcome the problem in two methods like

1. File Name is changed like views1.py, views2.py etc., but large applications doesn't have possible this method.

2. In python have solution, like
    from appName1 import views as v1
    from appName2 import views as v2

In More number of application in One Project to have more no.of urls are created. So, this urls.py file is not present in project level file. urls.py file is present in application level file will be created in application. It is a good practice and code reusability is achieved.

    New Step #3: Create or copy a new file 'urls.py' from project folder to your application folder
        - update your urls in urls.py file

    Step #4: Goto urls.py file in project folder
        - connect to urls in project folders like

            import django.conf.urls import include

            path('appName/', include(appName.urls))

        ex:
        path('urlTest/', include('urlTest.urls'))

    In Browser url like http://127.0.0.1:8000/appName/url (ex: http://127.0.0.1:8000/urlTest/one)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Model:

View - Business Logics
Template - Presentation layers

VIEW:

Style - CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)
Image/ video /audio /CSS /JavaScript - Static Files

Create a static folder in project folder and upload your static files.

Rendering HTML Files or Create a Template Folder

    -create a template folder in project folder
    -create a html file in template folder
    -connect the html file to views.py in application folder

        def home(request):
        return render(request, 'index.html')
    
    -goto settings.py in project folder

        import os 

        TEMPLATES Section add the path

            'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')],
        
    -follow above Step 3 and 4

    Incase your pass it values from views.py to HTML files

        views.py

        def home(request):
        return render(request, 'index.html',{'Name': 'Arunkumar'})

        index.html

        <h2>{{Name}}</h2>
